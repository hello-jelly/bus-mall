Market Research Stories:

Researcher 1 - As a researcher, I need to do market analysis on products to test their potential customer interest. The design of the app should stay true to our brand image.

Researcher 2 - As a market researcher I need to be able to determine which products are most desirable in order to reduce costs during manufacturing and print production.

Researcher 3 - As a market researcher I'm interested in the total number of clicks, the percentage of times an item was clicked when shown, and will use the results of this study to determine which products will be for sale in the final catalog.



User Stories:

User 1 - As a mature user I need the app to be easy to understand and read in order to contribute to this survey.
